## Local development

In the project directory run:
`./runcorrosion.sh`

In another terminal run `./startlocal.sh`. Running them in separate terminals lets you watch the logs for both.

### Config notes
The Phoenix app will look for an address in the env var `CORRO_API_URL`, which `startlocal.sh` sets. The host and port must match the Corrosion API address in `corrosion/config-local.toml`. i.e.

`CORRO_API_URL="http://localhost:8081/v1"` in `startlocal.sh` matches Corrosion config section

```
[api]
addr = "127.0.0.1:8081"
``` 


## Check the local Corrosion API

```
‚ùØ curl http://localhost:8081/v1/queries \
-H "content-type: application/json" \
-d "\"SELECT * FROM node_messages\""
{"columns":["pk","node_id","message","sequence","timestamp"]}
{"eoq":{"time":8.3e-8}}
```
